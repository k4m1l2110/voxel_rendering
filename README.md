<h1>Voxel game project</h1>
<p>This is my simple voxel game project on OpenGL. It is on very early stage as I am new to graphics programming and does only simple square map rendering with perlin noise (for now).
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>Install OpenGL, GLFW, and glm library, glad,KHR and stb is already included with project</p>
<p> > cmake .</p>
<p> > ./voxel_rendering x y z (Map coordinates) </p>
<p> Tested only on Linux, but should work as well on Windows </p>
