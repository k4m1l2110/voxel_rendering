<h1>Voxel game project</h1>
<p>This is my simple voxel game project on OpenGL. It is on very early stage as I am new to graphics programming and does only simple square map rendering with perlin noise (for now). Project based on Victor Gordan tutorial: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPaoO-vpZnumdcb4tZc4x5Q-v7CkrQ6M-&si=iTRolR1xkNESmQu9</p>
